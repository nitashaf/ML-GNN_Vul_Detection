# ML-GNN_Vul_Detection
VIMFG-VAn is a novel approach that leverage GraphSAGE (SAGE Convolution) for scalable node embedding. To enhance the model's
efficetiveness we integrated Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) graphs that capture both data dependencies and control flow ensuring
that the model learns from meaningful patterns in source code.

Cyber Security Group Project: Used GNN to detect vulnerabilities in code binaries
This is a group project with Mike Kadoshnikov, Jacob Tanner,  Dillon Shaffer and Layton McCafferty
